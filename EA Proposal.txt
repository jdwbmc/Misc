Operations Architecture
Definition: The IT infrastructure of an enterprise will typically comprise many different systems and platforms, often in different geographic locations. Operations architecture ensures that these systems perform as expected by centrally unifying the control of operational procedures and automating the execution of operational tasks. It also reports the performance of the IT infrastructure. The implementation of an operations architecture consists of a dedicated set of tools and processes which are designed to provide centralisation and automation.

Technology Architecture
Definition: Technology architecture associates application components from application architecture with technology components representing software and hardware components. Its components are generally acquired in the marketplace and can be assembled and configured to constitute the enterprise’s technological infrastructure. Technology architecture provides a more concrete view of the way in which application components will be realized and deployed. It enables the migration problems that can arise between the different steps of the IS evolution path to be studied earlier. It provides a more precise means of evaluating responses to constraints (nonfunctional requirements) concerning the IS, notably by estimating hardware and network sizing needs or by setting up server or storage redundancy.
